# Rainbow ðŸŒˆ

Rainbow is a small, safe, language intended for embedding in larger programs.

## Getting started

1. [Install rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html)
2. Run the REPL: `cd rainbow_repl && cargo run`.
   (On Unix systems, you might need to install ncurses to satisfy all dependencies: `sudo apt-get install libncursesw5 libncursesw5-dev`)

The above should land you on a REPL where you can play around with Rainbow.
